# CV Builder

## Project Overview
CV Builder is an AI-powered platform designed to help users create professional CVs and cover letters. The platform follows British CV rules and offers advanced features like ATS compatibility analysis, localized templates, and AI-powered content suggestions.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), with support for branch-specific preview deployments. The production environment is automatically built and deployed for the `main` branch, while the `test` branch has a dedicated staging environment.
- **Backend**: Deployed to Azure App Service. Separate app services are used for production and staging environments.
- **CI/CD Workflows**:
  - **Frontend**: Deployments are managed directly through Vercel's GitHub integration.
  - **Backend**: GitHub Actions builds and deploys changes to Azure App Service when changes are made in the `backend/` directory.
